# Project Overview
This project features a comprehensive Tableau Dashboard designed to visualize the sales patterns of specific distribution centers (DCs). Key functionalities and components of the project include:

# Tableau Dashboard
Interactive Sales Patterns: Users can click on any distribution center within the dashboard to view detailed sales patterns specific to that DC.

Error Metrics Display: For each sales pattern analyzed, the dashboard showcases the most relevant error metrics, enabling users to assess the accuracy and reliability of the sales data.
# Predictive Sales Modeling
Sales History Generation: The project incorporates a robust model capable of generating extended sales histories based on existing data. For instance, using one year of sales data, the model can project sales trends for the next two years or more by identifying and leveraging underlying sales patterns.
# Flexible Reporting Options:
Store-Wise Analysis: Generate sales histories segmented by individual stores.

Distribution Center (DC) Wise Analysis: Create sales projections specific to each distribution center.

Combined Analysis: Option to generate comprehensive sales histories that encompass both store-wise and DC-wise data for a holistic view.
# Additional Features
User-Friendly Interface: The dashboard is designed with an intuitive interface, ensuring that users can easily navigate and extract meaningful insights without extensive training.

Dynamic Visualizations: Incorporates various visualization tools such as charts, graphs, and heatmaps to present sales data in an easily interpretable format.


Real-Time Data Updates: Ensures that the sales patterns and projections are based on the most recent data, providing up-to-date insights for strategic decision-making.
Benefits

Enhanced Decision Making: By visualizing sales patterns and providing accurate projections, stakeholders can make informed decisions to optimize inventory, improve distribution strategies, and boost overall sales performance.

Error Minimization: Displaying key error metrics allows for continuous monitoring and improvement of the sales forecasting model, ensuring high levels of accuracy and reliability.
Scalability: The model's ability to generate extended sales histories makes it adaptable for future growth and varying data scales.
